  <h1> High School </h1>
<br>
  <p1>Before moving to Pennsylvania, I resided in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. In Pewaukee, I played many sports growing up, but basketball in particular really resonated with me. While playing in Pewaukee, I got to play against some really great players. Some of which now play in the <I>NBA</I>, like <b>Tyler Herro</b>. If you follow the link, you'll see my team playing against Tyler Herro's team and beating him in the playoffs!</p1>

  <h2>College</h2>
<br>
  <p3>I initially committed to play at a school in Minnesota, but due to <b>COVID</b> I chose to transfer closer to home</p3>
